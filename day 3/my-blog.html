            <h2>HAWAI ADVENTURE</h2>
            <p>Even though I have many short stories about traveling the world, I want to share the one from Hawaii. I’ll never forget the time I landed on the remote Hawaiian island of Molokai and was told, “We have a wedding and two funerals on the island, and so we have run out of cars.” It was at about the same time as a popular movie with a similar title was out, so the statement had a humorous overtone.

                However, since this was hang-loose Hawaii, I was assured by a mellow employee that all would work out and so there was really nothing I could do but relax into it. The car agency arranged for (and paid for) a cab to deliver us to our condo so we could check-in, and told us that the next morning someone would pick us up and deliver us to the mule ride.

            <h2>DAY 2</h2>
            <p>“I have been dreaming of visiting the Ban Gioc Waterfall ever since I saw photos of it a few years ago. At that time, I still didn’t know much about Vietnam, but I knew it was home to this majestic waterfall, similar to Plitvice Lakes in my home country of Croatia.

                I’ll never forget this experience. First, I heard its powerful sound, and then when I finally saw it, I was in awe. I won’t lie, I was overwhelmed and even shed a few tears. It was so powerful, and I can still feel the water droplets softly landing on my face – pure happiness.</p>
